1,CMS-2010-0020-0003,Individual,"I am a patient who relies on interventional pain management physicians for my care.  I am writing to you because of my grave concern for the future of patient access to this type of care.  Based on my knowledge of the planned reduction in reimbursement, it is my firmly held belief that, unless Congress takes action soon, seniors will lose access to interventional pain management. If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters.

I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess.

Based on my knowledge of the planned reduction in reimbursement, it is my firmly held belief that, unless Congress takes action soon, seniors will lose access to interventional pain management. If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters.

If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters. Im very much interested in hearing your response and hoping for your support on these important issues.  Once again, thank you for all your help.For more information visit  www.asipp.org   Print Name: _______________________________________________   Signature: _________________________________________________ Date: ________________  Email address: _____________________________________________",0.9866949319839478,NEGATIVE,"['Congress', 'ASC', 'Congress', 'Government']","[{'summary_text': ' A patient who relies on interventional pain management physicians for his care writes to Congress .

If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters. Im very much interested in hearing your response and hoping for your support on these important issues.  Once again, thank you for all your help.For more information visit  www.asipp.org   Print Name: _______________________________________________   Signature: _________________________________________________ Date: ________________  Email address: _____________________________________________",0.9866949319839478,NEGATIVE,"['Congress', 'ASC', 'Congress', 'Government']","[{'summary_text': ' A patient who relies on interventional pain management physicians for his care writes to Congress .

If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters. Im very much interested in hearing your response and hoping for your support on these important issues.  Once again, thank you for all your help.For more information visit  www.asipp.org   Print Name: _______________________________________________   Signature: _________________________________________________ Date: ________________  Email address: _____________________________________________",0.9866949319839478,NEGATIVE,"['Congress', 'ASC', 'Congress', 'Government']","[{'summary_text': ' A patient who relies on interventional pain management physicians for his care writes to Congress .

If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters. Im very much interested in hearing your response and hoping for your support on these important issues.  Once again, thank you for all your help.",0.9866949319839478,NEGATIVE,"['Congress', 'ASC', 'Congress', 'Government']","[{'summary_text': ' A patient who relies on interventional pain management physicians for his care writes to Congress .

This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time.

Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures. This is one of the most effective locations for these procedures to be performed, along with physician offices. Since the Government has decided to reduce payments to offices and ASCs, we will be forced to return to the hospital setting.  This is, without a doubt, a less effective, more inefficient, and more expensive setting. It appears to be criminal to punish both of the most effective interventional pain management settings, namely the offices, and ASCs, with draconian cuts.  If this is allowed to stand, it will significantly affect our access to these valuable services which have significantly improved our quality of life.  Although we appreciate the bills introduced by Honorable Mike Crapo (R-ID) in the Senate and Honorable Kendrick Meek (D-17th Fl) and Wally Herger (R-2nd CA) in the House; these unfortunately will not fix the ASC issue for interventional pain management. They also would be extremely expensive and consequently, we request a temporary reprieve for interventional procedures performed in ASCs by a carve-out for 9 procedures which will cost $8 million in the year 2008 and a total of $34 million by 2010. Please act immediately, as these issues are extremely important to the American public, namely your voters.

Humphrey Building, Room 445-G200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201 Re: MS-1392-FC Dear Mr. Weems: As a concerned interventional pain management nurse I would like to comment on multiple disparities which exist between ASC setting and HOPD setting. These disparities and the CMSs new proposals and classifications will hinder patient access.  I am concerned about status indicator for CPT Codes 72285 and 72295 and non-payable issue which is related to discography. CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service when it is performed independently in the ASC setting. It was our understanding that in spite of significant cuts for interventional pain management the whole purpose was to apply the standards uniformly but it does not seem so. Discography procedures have two components: an injection portion that is reported by either CPT Code 62290 (Injection procedure for discography, in lumbar spine) or CPT Cod 62291 (Injection procedure for discography in cervical or thoracic spine), and a radiology portion that is reported by either CPT Code 72285 (discography interpretation and supervision in cervical spine) or CPT Code 72295 (discography interpretation and supervision in lumbar spine). I believe that discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system. This payment policy fails to recognize inequality between multiple settings and importance of these being done in an ASC setting. The second issue relates to the update to the conversion factor while ASCs are facing losses, hospitals will still have an upper hand with a better update factor. This should be changed where both update factors are the same. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Final Rule.  Sincerely,Kristine Lobotzke RN414-325-3701Greenfield WI 53221",0.9991253018379211,NEGATIVE,"['Centersfor', 'areand', 'dicaidServicesDepartmentofHealthandHumanServices', 'H.Humphrey', 'FC', 'AS', 'CMS', 'CMS', 'AS']","[{'summary_text': ' CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service .

115,CMS-2010-0020-0117,Physician,"To whom it may concern:Regarding: payment for CPT code 68816     My name is Chris Haggerty and I am a dual oculoplastic fellowship trained ophthalmologist.  I would like to make a few comments on the proposed payment schedule for CPT code 68816 (balloon catheter dilation of the nasolacrimal duct with placement of a Crawford tube).   First of all this procedure requires general anesthesia, so I dont think performing this procedure in an office setting makes any sense.   Secondly this procedure takes much more time, and is more technically challenging than performing a simple probing with placement of a Crawford tube (CPT code 68815).  This procedure (68816) requires placing a balloon which has a larger diameter and is harder to pass and sometimes can be quite a struggle in some cases although other cases go very smoothly.  It also requires several cycles of inflating and deflating a balloon.  The advantage of this procedure is that it has a higher success rate in curing patients of their epiphora.  I would think that a procedure that is more challenging and takes longer would receive a higher reimbursement. Thirdly, although this procedure can be performed in an ASC, or hospital OR setting, the overall speed and efficiency in ASC settings are generally much greater than in a regular hospital OR.  Currently I am prohibited from performing these procedures in the ASC secondary to the reimbursement.  The balloon alone costs $306, and your proposed payment in the ASC setting is only $434.  If you raise the reimbursement for the ASC significantly then these procedures can be performed just as well, but in a much more efficient and cheaper manner than if they were performed in a hospital. I hope these comments are useful to you.  Please feel free to contact me.  Thanks so much for your time in reading my E-mail and reviewing your proposed reimbursement schedule.

116,CMS-2010-0020-0118,Physician,"The proposed interim payment in the ASC setting for the new CPT code 68816 is $433.69. The payment for 68816 in the hospital outpatient setting is $1,193.03. CMS calculated the ASC payment for 68816 based on an office setting. However, the majority of procedures are performed under general anesthesia in a hospital setting or ASC and NOT in the office. I am a pediatric ophthalmologist practicing in an academic setting. 100% of my 68816 procedures are performed in the Hosptial Outpatient setting. 100% of my probing procedures including those needing balloon dilation are performed on children, all of who require general anesthesia as there is increased risk of damage to the lacrimal system , the eye and overall stress to the child if performed in the office setting without anesthesia. Balloon dilation is the treatment of choice when primary probing does not succeed or as the primary procedure if performed over the age of one.  Performing the LacriCath procedures take at least 6-10 minutes longer per eye than the standard probing procedure. First, the standard probing is passed through the lacrimal system. Then, the LacriCath is passed. The balloon is inflated to 8 atmospheres at the 15mm mark for 90 seconds, released, then re-inflated to 8 atmospheres for 60 seconds, released; the LacriCath is then retracted to the 10mm mark and the balloon is inflated to 8 atmospheres for 90 seconds, released and reinflated for 60 seconds, then removed. So, once the LacriCath is in place, the balloon is inflated for exactly 5 minutes plus the interim time to release the balloon and reposition the LacriCath; whereas a simple probing may take just a minute or less per eye. The proposed lower ASC payment serves as a financial deterrent forcing  us (ophthalmologists) to treat patients in the more costly hospital outpatient setting rather than in the more cost efficient ASC. The cost of the balloon catheter alone is $306 relative to the payment of $434 which CMS is proposing for 68816 in the ASC setting. This does not allow me or the ASC to economically treat patients in an ambulatory setting.

122,CMS-2010-0020-0124,Physician,"I am concerned about fees for CPT code 68816.  I perform 100% of these procedures under anesthesia in an ambulatory surgery center under general anesthesia in children under the age of 5 years.This procedure can not be done in an office setting without general anesthesia in children.  That would be very unsafe.  It takes twice as much time to perform this procedure than nasolacrimal duct probing.  This procedure is typically performed in children whom simple probing does not work.  It is less costly to perform the procedure in an ASC than in the hospital.  If the reimbursement is reduced for ASCs, then you incentise the practitioner to perform the procedure in the more expensive hospital setting.  The balloon catheter costs $306 to the ASC.  The proposed facility fee for the whole procedure is $434.  This makes it impossible for me or the ASC to economically treat patients in an ambulatory setting.  I recommend you set the facility fee for the ASC at the same rate as the hospital at $1193.03.  I recommend that surgeon fees rise to $215 from $205.

The essence of your proposal will be to push procedures back in to the hightest cost, least efficient, most dangerous setting available to patients.

125,CMS-2010-0020-0127,Physician,"As pediatric ophthalmologists, we are fortunate to be able to offer our patients/families with nasolacrimal (tear) duct obstructions several excellent procedures to permanently open the blockage.  I personally am glad that the new code, 68816, specific for balloon dilation of the nasolacrimal duct, has been approved and will be instituted beginning in January of 2008. This procedure is my procedure of choice in almost all probings after  the age of 2 as an initial procedure and as well if an initial probing procedure has failed.  The use of the balloon dilator has allowed me to have successful results without the potential complications of silicone intubation into the tear duct.  The most common complication of intubation is dislodging of the tube, which in a study that I presented as a poster at a recent AAPOS (American Association of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus) meeting was 19.7%.  Other complications included canalicular cheesewiring, corneal abrasion, difficulty with tube placement, post operative monitoring and a 20% rate of needing a second anesthesia for tube removal.  There were no complications with the balloon dilation procedure in my study.In general, the balloon dilation procedure is more complex and time consuming than the silicone intubation, and thus I strongly feel that the physician reimbursement should be allocated accordingly.  The physician should be paid more than the reimbursement for silicone intubation and that is not reflected in the 2008 schedule.  In addition, this procedure should be performed for the most part in ASCs, but the cost of the goods do not even make up for the ASC costs and thus we currently have to take these patients to hospitals for their surgery instead of the more cost effective ASCs. Sincerely,Robert S.

This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.

156,CMS-2010-0020-0158,Physician," December 18, 2007 Mr. Kerry WeemsAdministratorCenters for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesDepartment of Health and Human ServicesAttention: MS-1392-FCHubert H. Humphrey Building, Room 445-G200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201 Re: MS-1392-FC Dear Mr. Weems: As a concerned interventional pain management physician I would like to comment on multiple disparities which exist between ASC setting and HOPD setting. These disparities and the CMSs new proposals and classifications will hinder patient access.  I am concerned about status indicator for CPT Codes 72285 and 72295 and non-payable issue which is related to discography. CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service when it is performed independently in the ASC setting. It was our understanding that in spite of significant cuts for interventional pain management the whole purpose was to apply the standards uniformly but it does not seem so. Discography procedures have two components: an injection portion that is reported by either CPT Code 62290 (Injection procedure for discography, in lumbar spine) or CPT Code 62291 (Injection procedure for discography in cervical or thoracic spine), and a radiology portion that is reported by either CPT Code 72285 (discography interpretation and supervision in cervical spine) or CPT Code 72295 (discography interpretation and supervision in lumbar spine). I believe that discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system. This payment policy fails to recognize inequality between multiple settings and importance of these being done in an ASC setting. The second issue relates to the update to the conversion factor. While ASCs are facing losses, hospitals will still have an upper hand with a better update factor. This should be changed so that both update factors are the same.  In addition, CMS should delay implementing the payment cap for office-based procedures.The present formula appears to be arbitrary. To avoid exponential increases in procedures performed in all settings specifically in-office settings, CMS should establish that these procedures should be performed by only well-trained qualified physicians and in accredited office settings, thus creating an accreditation standard for offices to perform interventional procedures. This philosophy may be applied to other settings to simply reduce the overuse. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Final Rule.  Sincerely,Antonio Mesa, D.O.Interventional Neurology Consultants, P.A.7800 SW 87th Avenue  Suite B250Miami, FL 33173",0.9996017217636108,NEGATIVE,"['Centersfor', 'dicareand', 'dicaidServicesDepartmentofHealthandHumanServices', 'H.Humphrey', 'AS', 'CMS', 'CMS', 'ASC', 'ASC', 'AS', 'AS']","[{'summary_text': ' Discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system .

If past actions are any guide, it is certain that Medicaid and third party payors will follow Medicare, cutting their reimbursement for these valuable services as well. As a concerned patient, I write urging you to take steps to stop the pending physician reimbursement cuts and the devastating ASC cuts for interventional pain management procedures. I am exremely disapointed that Congress does not appear to be willing to take action prior to the holiday recess. This inaction could very well cause seniors to lose access to interventional pain management.  I understand that the physician payment fix should be for at least two years with a change in the law rather than yearly fix which will accumulate the cuts in the third year to 20% at one time. I also support modest cuts for Medicare Advantage Plan; however, we do not support complete elimination of Medicare Advantage Plans.This is especially true in Illinois as malpractice costs are rising for interventional pain management physicians.  Based on these statistics it is obvious that physicians will have an extremely difficult time continuing to practice and offer the care that they are currently. A second issue of concern relates to ambulatory surgery center payment cuts for interventional pain management procedures.

202,CMS-2010-0020-0204,Physician,"December 18, 2007 Mr. Kerry WeemsAdministratorCenters for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesDepartment of Health and Human ServicesAttention: MS-1392-FCHubert H. Humphrey Building, Room 445-G200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201 Re: MS-1392-FC Dear Mr. Weems: As a concerned interventional pain management physician I would like to comment on multiple disparities which exist between ASC setting and HOPD setting. These disparities and the CMSs new proposals and classifications will hinder patient access.  I am concerned about status indicator for CPT Codes 72285 and 72295 and non-payable issue which is related to discography. CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service when it is performed independently in the ASC setting. It was our understanding that in spite of significant cuts for interventional pain management the whole purpose was to apply the standards uniformly but it does not seem so. Discography procedures have two components: an injection portion that is reported by either CPT Code 62290 (Injection procedure for discography, in lumbar spine) or CPT Cod 62291 (Injection procedure for discography in cervical or thoracic spine), and a radiology portion that is reported by either CPT Code 72285 (discography interpretation and supervision in cervical spine) or CPT Code 72295 (discography interpretation and supervision in lumbar spine). I believe that discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system. This payment policy fails to recognize inequality between multiple settings and importance of these being done in an ASC setting. The second issue relates to the update to the conversion factor while ASCs are facing losses, hospitals will still have an upper hand with a better update factor. This should be changed where both update factors are the same. In addition, CMS should delay implementing the payment cap for office-based procedures.The present formula appears to be arbitrary. To avoid exponential increases in procedures performed in all settings specifically in-office settings, CMS should establish that these procedures should be performed by only well-trained qualified physicians and in accredited office settings, thus creating an accreditation standard for offices to perform interventional procedures. This philosophy may be applied to other settings to simply reduce the overuse. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Final Rule.  Sincerely,Lora Brown, MD",0.9996048808097839,NEGATIVE,"['Centersfor', 'dicareand', 'dicaidServicesDepartmentofHealthandHumanServices', 'H.Humphrey', 'AS', 'CMS', 'CMS', 'ASC', 'ASC', 'AS']",[{'summary_text': ' Discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system .

These disparities and the CMSs new proposals and classifications will hinder patient access.  I am concerned about status indicator for CPT Codes 72285 and 72295 and non-payable issue which is related to discography. CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service when it is performed independently in the ASC setting. It was our understanding that in spite of significant cuts for interventional pain management the whole purpose was to apply the standards uniformly but it does not seem so. Discography procedures have two components: an injection portion that is reported by either CPT Code 62290 (Injection procedure for discography, in lumbar spine) or CPT Cod 62291 (Injection procedure for discography in cervical or thoracic spine), and a radiology portion that is reported by either CPT Code 72285 (discography interpretation and supervision in cervical spine) or CPT Code 72295 (discography interpretation and supervision in lumbar spine). I believe that discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system. This payment policy fails to recognize inequality between multiple settings and importance of these being done in an ASC setting. The second issue relates to the update to the conversion factor while ASCs are facing losses, hospitals will still have an upper hand with a better update factor. This should be changed where both update factors are the same. In addition, CMS should delay implementing the payment cap for office-based procedures.The present formula appears to be arbitrary. To avoid exponential increases in procedures performed in all settings specifically in-office settings, CMS should establish that these procedures should be performed by only well-trained qualified physicians and in accredited office settings, thus creating an accreditation standard for offices to perform interventional procedures.

222,CMS-2010-0020-0224,Physician,"January 24, 2008 Mr. Kerry WeemsAdministratorCenters for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesDepartment of Health and Human ServicesAttention: MS-1392-FCHubert H. Humphrey Building, Room 445-G200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201 Re: MS-1392-FC Dear Mr. Weems: As a concerned interventional pain management physician I would like to comment on multiple disparities which exist between ASC setting and HOPD setting. These disparities and the CMSs new proposals and classifications will hinder patient access.  I am concerned about status indicator for CPT Codes 72285 and 72295 and non-payable issue which is related to discography. CMS pays separately for radiology portion of discography when it is performed independently in the HOPD setting, however it does not pay separately for the very same service when it is performed independently in the ASC setting. It was our understanding that in spite of significant cuts for interventional pain management the whole purpose was to apply the standards uniformly but it does not seem so. Discography procedures have two components: an injection portion that is reported by either CPT Code 62290 (Injection procedure for discography, in lumbar spine) or CPT Cod 62291 (Injection procedure for discography in cervical or thoracic spine), and a radiology portion that is reported by either CPT Code 72285 (discography interpretation and supervision in cervical spine) or CPT Code 72295 (discography interpretation and supervision in lumbar spine). I believe that discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system. This payment policy fails to recognize inequality between multiple settings and importance of these being done in an ASC setting. The second issue relates to the update to the conversion factor while ASCs are facing losses, hospitals will still have an upper hand with a better update factor. This should be changed where both update factors are the same. In addition, CMS should delay implementing the payment cap for office-based procedures.The present formula appears to be arbitrary. To avoid exponential increases in procedures performed in all settings specifically in-office settings, CMS should establish that these procedures should be performed by only well-trained qualified physicians and in accredited office settings, thus creating an accreditation standard for offices to perform interventional procedures. This philosophy may be applied to other settings to simply reduce the overuse. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Final Rule.  Sincerely, John H Stephenson, M.D.",0.9996059536933899,NEGATIVE,"['Centersfor', 'dicareand', 'dicaidServicesDepartmentofHealthandHumanServices', 'H.Humphrey', 'AS', 'CMS', 'CMS', 'ASC', 'ASC', 'AS']",[{'summary_text': ' Discography should be a separately payable service in the ASC as it is not treated as a surgical procedure eligible for separate payment under the payment system .
